<h2>My top 3 Movies of all Times </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Megan</h3>
<p>
    Robot movie, fun to watch. Teaches the importance of parents in our life alongwith the devastating effects of bringing robot to too much use in our life.
</p>

<h3>Laapata Ladies</h3>
<p>
    Inspiring, nice and eye opening. Talks about importance of education and the side effects of patrirarchial society. Motivates young women especially from rural cities to achieve their academic and future desires.
</p>

<h3>Truth or Dare</h3>
<p>
    Scary (for me atleast). The movie revolves around the game of truth and dare except for it is linked to paranomal activites and a haunted past.
